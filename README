Introduction
----------------------


Eircog (pronounced with a Dutch "g") is a Python tool that is used to actively generate WEP keys for
nearby access points that are vulnerable to the Netopia predictable WEP key generation issue discovered
by Kevin Devine, most commonly found in the routers of a particularly large Irish telco. It uses system calls to obtain the SSIDs of nearby access points under Linux and OS X.

This application requires Python (Imagine.). It also requires iwtools under Linux (and permission to run iwlist). All testing was done with Python version 2.5.2. 

This tool was not built with malice in mind but frankly has little honourable application.

Command-line arguments:
----------------------

--help: show help information
--s=SSIDSTRING, --ssidonly=SSIDSTRING: return the key(s) for a given string and immediately exit.
--interface=INTERFACE, -i=INTERFACE: Specify the interface to scan with. This is MANDATORY in Linux. Has no effect under OS X. 
-d, --daemon: Run the script constantly, scanning every SLEEPINTERVAL (by default this is 5 seconds). 
-4: Generate 4 keys instead of the standard 1.
